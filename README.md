# CNN and Transformer-based architecture with scattering transform
This repository contains source codes for all models implemented in my dissertation for my Master Degree.

## Model Explanation
There are 3 architectures used in this project, including a CNN-based model, vision transformer, and swin transformer.

1. CNN-based architecture/n
This includes both traditional CNN and other existing architectures. All of them are implemented with and without scattering transform. For other pre-trained architectures, we try replacing different numbers of early layers for experimenting as seen in sub-folders.
